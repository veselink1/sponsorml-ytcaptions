    "Many of you probably have\n",

    "you know how many ranks\n",

    "Ask them?\n",
    "Although a common explanation\n",
    "is that single-rank memory\n",
    "has chips on only one side\n",
    "while a dual-rank module has\n",
    "memory chips on both sides,\n",
    "it can be hard to tell how\n",
    "many ranks a stick of RAM has\n",

    "even if it doesn't have a head spreader.\n",
    "Sometimes modules that appear\n",
    "to have memory chips on both sides\n",
    "actually act as one big rank,\n",
    "and then you have the fact\n",
    "that trying to figure this out\n",
    "in your BIOS or in a system utility\n",
    "doesn't always give you\n",
    "an accurate answer either.\n",
    "Some RAM modules will have a 1R or 2R\n",
    "to indicate whether they're single-\n",
    "or dual-rank, respectively.\n",
    "And quad-rank memory is quite\n",
    "unusual on regular desktops,\n",
    "so odds are you won't be\n",
    "seeing too much of it.\n",
    "If that isn't too helpful,\n",
    "you might try looking at a spec sheet\n",
    "or checking out online resources\n",
    "where users have compiled lists\n",
    "of single- and dual-rank memory kits.\n",
    "Now, it also turns out that because\n",
    "modern memory integrated circuits, or ICs,\n",
    "tend to be 8-gigabit capacity\n",
    "as opposed to the older standard of 4,\n",
    "newer 8-gigabyte sticks\n",
    "tend to be single rank\n",
    "while newer 16-gig sticks\n",
    "tend to be dual-rank.\n",
    "And if you're confused\n",
    "about the math there,\n",
    "one rank is made up of eight ICs.\n",
    "This means that even if\n",
    "you won't use all of it,\n",
    "32 gigabytes of memory\n",
    "may be the sweet spot for speed today,\n",
    "though this will keep changing\n",
    "as IC capacity increases.\n",
    "But remember that whether\n",
    "you see real benefits\n",
    "really depends on your workload,\n",
    "and more ranks can\n",
    "paradoxically add more latency,\n",
    "depending on what you're doing.\n",
    "So do your research and\n",
