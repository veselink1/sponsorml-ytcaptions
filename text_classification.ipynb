    "## Transfomers for binary text classification\n",
    "This notebook seeks to accomplish the task of sponsored-content detection using a binary text classification model. The text classification model is created by fine-tuning a DistilBERT pre-trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Several similar projects based on a BERT-type text classification model have been written about in on the Internet. Unfortunately, in both instances the authors do not share details about the performance of the model. Instead, they used vague language like \"95% accuracy\" without qualifying that in any meaningful way. What is more, the trained models in both instances then demonstrably perform poorly in the downstream task of task classification, but no exact numbers are reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to investigate how well a text classification model can perform on what is essentially a span extraction task."

      "(\"suspicious speaking of smells though let's take a second and hear a word from the sponsor of this video now you guys know i love smelling like someone's expensive wife because that's what i am i am someone's expensive wife you know him his name's tony off-screen tony if you will now i love smelling expensive but i don't want to spend all that money on expensive perfumes so what's the best solution the sponsor of today's video which is scentbird if you don't know you most likely already do but scentbird is a subscription fragrance service that gives you the opportunity to shop over 600 that's a lot over 600 brands that's so many and that is a flexible subscription and it is monthly but no worries if you are like me and you have like 40 of these 40 of these little twist capsule guys in your cabinet back there you can just skip a month they come in these little containers little twist guys twist just like a lipstick fool proof to use and then you can just take out the little vial right here and it says exactly what the name is i'll go over what they smell like and which ones i got in a second but that's how you use it and i personally love that it's not like a tester one it's not like a travel size it's look how big look how big this is it look okay this is my face that's big and it says that it's a 30-day supply but like girl it's more than that okay if you have no idea what you're doing when it comes to fragrances to different scents what you should wear for each occasion what does it mean when it says that something smells more musky or has notes of lavender and lilac if you're completely lost don't worry they actually have a quiz on the site that is very easy to use and then that way they will point you in the right direction so you can smell beautiful and perfect and valuable spicy if you want you'll be able to get what you need and with the holidays coming up it is such a good present my sister doesn't watch my videos so it's fine that i'm saying this this is actually what i'm giving to her this year i'm gonna be gifting her a yearly subscription so you can actually do three months six months or 12 months there's perfumes there's colognes there's unisex options like i said it is the perfect gift for this holiday season and the great thing is that once you choose either the three month six month or a 12 month subscription plan go go ahead and send it right over to the recipient's email so that way they take it over from there and if you're thinking i don't know if i want to sign someone up for like a subscription service don't worry because scentbird actually has gift sets available for whoever so the ones they sent me this month were power suit by deck of scarlet i've already smelled this one it smells very powerful like i'm about to dismantle empires and aren't i aren't i going to do that and then light blue by dolce gabbana i feel like this is like this is like a staple like this is one that people like know a lot about know a lot about it's a perfume chelsea and then pure vanilla by a love vanilla this will be interesting because i typically don't like vanilla scents so it has vanilla helio heliotrope i'm pretty sure i'm pronouncing that wrong and then tonka bean so it's not just vanilla all right so here's that the la vanilla one oh my god that's really good oh my god it smells like my nana oh that's so weird one of the last ones i got smelled like my mom and that one smells like my nana okay i love that one like i feel like i need to write on the bottom smells like nana i'm such a weirdo okay and then dolce gabbana light blue i feel like i should say this dolce gabbana light blue like it doesn't in the commercials if people like swimming you know ooh that one has like a little hint of like citrus kind of oh my god i'm so smart oh we should make this like a game every time so this one has notes of lemon apple cedar bamboo and bluebell i know this is something probably people like don't show too much but like i love that it comes with these cards and like tells me exactly what's in there so i sound like i know what i'm talking about when i say i'm a perfume connoisseur like i said i just mean that i am a hoarder this one smells really really good it that one definitely is lighter than the other one oh my god that's why it's called light blue okay now power suit i already smelled and it smells real good like real good and it has notes of ooh creamy sandalwood opposed to normal sandalwood skin musk that's that's a gross word skin skin musk orange flower which tony's gonna love this one and jasmine he loves both those smells and cardamom i don't know what that means but i already know like this one's gonna be a little a little bit more on the spicy side that is so good oh my god this is what i would wear with a with black jeans heels a like loose silky top and an oversized blazer and a power pony and i am forcing multi-level marketing companies to shut down that's this is what i'm gonna wear i love this one okay so whether it's gifting a subscription or treating yourself with scentbird you can get a decent amount of luxury fragrances for just 14 a month also with my code cc suarez 3 which i'll have linked down below and in that pinned comment i'll have the link and the code you can actually get your first month for just eleven dollars yep that is saving you thirty percent my friend mm-hmm not only am i helping you smell amazing but i'm saving you monies while doing so thank you again snet bird for sponsoring this video and now let's go ahead and get into our debauchery all right so like i said\", 1)\n",
      "(\"when someone upgrades you make more money too so like i said i'm gonna have all of this linked down below i will find a lot of their internal documents as well and i'll have those linked down below even if i have to put all of this on like and you know screenshot it and stuff with those documents and put it on my own website on my blog i've done that before for like mon8 stuff and other documents that i wanted to be able to share with y'all so that's the selfish suarezes.com and it's on the blog site so i'm gonna have that there if needed if i can't you know get the exact links to things um so i'm gonna go ahead and do that but as you can tell it's a scam it's a scam please do not fall for this any little w fab ladies if you are in mone please do not join this scam you deserve so much better and like i said i think it just really shows to a t how these people treat each other how they don't care about anyone else but their own pockets and how they're willing to do anything for money they these girls have been especially jasmine and i'm doing a deep dive on her you bet your butt the fact that she has been showing such a luxury lifestyle yet she she fell seven ranks from executive director to whatever the hell she was like seven drinks below that that's crazy she fell all almost all the way down the compensation plan that's insane good god this is whack alright friends i hope you enjoyed um keep in mind these financial mlms are whack to put it nicely the reps in these companies not all of them but a lot of the reps in these companies will have your ins like they will master report your instagram account your youtube videos it's crazy they will harass you to no end so there's a creator amal williams she's amazing she's a canadian creator she is a beautiful mother wife a woman of color she's absolutely gorgeous and very funny and she made a couple videos about these these people in these companies and like more like financial mlms this company specifically igenius and that was months ago and she's kind of taken a break from youtube she's coming back though i just talked to her she's coming back and they are still harassing her on instagram and her dms it is absolutely it's it's strange behavior it is strange strange behavior so i'm actually right before i put this video up i'm gonna make a second instagram account i'm like i'm gonna have to have a backup and it's unfortunate that i have to do that but that is honestly one of the many reasons why i had been not really covering these types of financial mlms too much because i've seen what they've done to marco marco gets his instagram page taken down at least once a month and he has a backup and now his main account's shadow band which really sucks but hopefully that won't happen to me because i don't really go after them on my instagram i just promote my videos i will definitely go after them here because youtube has different guidelines thank god thank thank the lord youtube protects its creators better than instagram does so i will have all of them all not all of her videos but her channel linked down below i'm going to add her to if you've ever looked in my description box not only are there affiliate links and codes and stuff like that in there but there are there's just a list of some of my favorite creators and my fellow commentary creators as well um so i'm gonna add her to that i'm gonna have a few of her videos linked down below too and you you guys know marco he is hilarious he puts out a lot of content exposing these types of mlms as well so please go watch their videos amal is realistically one of the only people that i have seen talk about this mlm and she has been harassed for it a lot i just posted her page on my community page earlier today as i was filming this and asked y'all to go subscribe to her i really want because she is coming back to youtube i really want to show her support and to really help her because she really brought not only this situation to my attention like 50 of y'all did y'all were flooding or flooding my dms i was just trying to eat some peanut butter pie with my family how white is that peanut butter pie what and the cassidy is happening anyways i hope you'll have a great rest of your day i will have my backup account linked down below too now sounds so strange for me to say that i've been thinking about it for a little bit and i'm like dang i should probably get one so hope you'll have a great rest of your day please know how important you are how valuable you are how amazing you are we got some big things coming up not only in december but at the beginning of next year as well and throughout next year so i hope you'll have a great rest of your day weekend at night whenever you're watching this you better stay spicy that blue glowing light behind me it does not say stay sploy it says stay spicy if you want to smell spicy and powerful and beautiful and expensive use the code and the link in my description box and in the pinned comment to get 30 percent off of scentbird fragrance subscriptions and also again thank you scentbird for sponsoring this video and continuing to sponsor my channel and thank you guys for supporting my sponsors without you i would not be able to do this full-time i wouldn't be able to do this period without you and when you support my sponsorships it really just makes it so i'm able to put out even more amazing crazy content for you so stay spicy and i'll see you in my next video bye you\", 0)\n"
